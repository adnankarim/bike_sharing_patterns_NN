# Project Bike Sharing (Overview)

In this project, I build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network
 from the ground up, I got the understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before 
we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. I learned to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

Built a neural network from scratch to analyse and predict on a dataset from UCI machine learning database.
